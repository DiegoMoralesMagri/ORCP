# ORCP: OpenRed Cryptographic Pattern

A Novel Self-Verifiable Graph-Morphology Based Cryptographic System

## Summary
ORCP introduces a new cryptographic paradigm based on graph morphology and self-verification, eliminating the need for traditional public key infrastructure. By leveraging topological invariants and spectral properties of dynamically generated graphs, ORCP achieves robust tamper detection, strong security (estimated at 105 bits), and real-time performance (0.52ms operations) with minimal memory usage (14 bytes). The protocol is validated both mathematically and empirically, demonstrating zero false positives in over one million verification tests and 100% detection of single-bit tampering. ORCP is suitable for decentralized networks, IoT devices, mobile applications, and post-quantum environments. Scalability analysis shows flexible configuration for various use cases, from lightweight IoT to high-security military and post-quantum scenarios.
